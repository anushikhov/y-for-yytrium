# Intro  

* How is our surrouding world constructed?  
* What rules control the phenomena of that world?  

At the beginning of 20th century, Physics entered into a new stage of development - the Modern stage, and from Classical Physics originated two new fields - Quantum Theory and Relativity Theory.  

Quantum Theory, specifically, was able to explain the periodic table of chemical elements in a new way.  

In Modern Physics, it is customary to divide the nature into three levels or worlds - microworld, macroworld and megaworld.  

In Astronomy, the limit of the observable universe is known as the space horizon which is about 15ly farther from us. (1ly ≈ 9,46 · 10¹² km)

The space with uniform directions is called isotropic.

Isotropy is uniformity in all orientations.  Greek: isos - equal  

According to the Theory of Relativity, time and space are codependent. 

According to Modern Physics, space-time and matter are also codependent.

The way objects are distributed in space and how they move affects the geometrical properties of the space. And the latter, being modified, counteraffects the distribution of the objects and their motion.  

In science, everything that exists independent of our consciousness and can directly or indirectly, through some special devices, affect our senses is known as matter - materia. 

There are two types of matter - substance and physical field.

Substances and fields have differing properties. For instance, substance can only move in speeds smaller than the speed of light in vacuum. Meanwhile, fields can spread with speeds equal to the speed of light.  
Fields have no mass and are continually spread across the space.  

There are four known fundamental interactions or fundamental forces - ordered from strongest to weakest, the forces are:

1. the strong nuclear force, 
1. the electromagnetic force, 
1. the weak nuclear force, 
1. gravity.  

Interactions between particles happen through the particle-field-particle scheme. One particle affects the other through its respective field.  

Fields have no clear bounderies and are permeable.  

Every natural phenomenon is either a process of transforming from one type of matter to the other, or from one type of motion to another.   

Matter and its movement are 'uncreatable' and 'undestructible'.  

This proposition is proved by the conservation laws of energy and impulse.  

An example of a transformation from substance to field is particle's and its antiparticle's annihilation. When an electron and positron collide, they vanish and turn into an electromagnetic field. The energy of the latter is the sum of the energies of the two particles.
